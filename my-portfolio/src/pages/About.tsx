      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a software engineer currently working in full-stack development. I have experience planning and executing backend/frontend solutions using modern web development technologies including Go, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS. 

My educational background consists of a focus on topics such as A.I. and signal processing. My internships have afforded me the opportunity to build ML frameworks to iterate on a range of deep learning experiments.

I have always been fascinated by the intersection of engineering and music theory, which has sparked my side passion for synthesizers and disk jockeying.</p>
